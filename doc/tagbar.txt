1. Intro						*tagbar-intro*

Tagbar is a plugin for browsing the tags of source code files. It provides a
sidebar that displays the ctags-generated tags of the current file, ordered by
their scope. This means that for example methods in C++ are displayed under
the class they are defined in.

Let's say we have the following code inside of a C++ file:
>
    namespace {
        char a;

        class Foo
        {
        public:
            Foo();
            ~Foo();
        private:
            int var;
        };
    };
<
Then Tagbar would display the tag information like so:
>
    __anon1* : namespace
      Foo : class
       +Foo()
       +~Foo()
       -var
      a
<
This example shows several important points. First, the tags are listed
indented below the scope they are defined in. Second, the type of a scope is
listed after its name and a colon. Third, tags for which the access/visibility
information is known are prefixed with a symbol indicating that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PSEUDO-TAGS						*tagbar-pseudotags*

The example also introduces the concept of "pseudo-tags". Pseudo-tags are tags
that are not explicitly defined in the file but have children in it. In this
example the namespace doesn't have a name and thus ctags doesn't generate a
tag for it, but since it has children it still needs to be displayed using an
auto-generated name.

Another case where pseudo-tags appear is in C++ implementation files. Since
classes are usually defined in a header file but the member methods and
variables in the implementation file the class itself won't generate a tag
in that file.

Since pseudo-tags don't really exist they cannot be jumped to from the Tagbar
window.

Pseudo-tags are denoted with an asterisk ('*') at the end of their name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPPORTED FEATURES					*tagbar-features*

The following features are supported by Tagbar:

  - Display tags under their correct scope.
  - Automatically update the tags when switching between buffers and editing
    files.
  - Display visibility information of tags if available.
  - Highlight the tag near the cursor while editing files.
  - Jump to a tag from the Tagbar window.
  - Display the complete prototype of a tag.
  - Tags can be sorted either by name or order of appearance in the file.
  - Scopes can be folded to hide uninteresting information.
  - Supports all of the languages that ctags does, i.e. Ant, Assembler, ASP,
    Awk, Basic, BETA, C, C++, C#, COBOL, DosBatch, Eiffel, Erlang, Flex,
    Fortran, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Lisp, Lua, Make, MatLab, OCaml, Pascal,
    Perl, PHP, Python, REXX, Ruby, Scheme, Shell script, SLang, SML, SQL, Tcl,
    Tex, Vera, Verilog, VHDL, Vim and YACC.
  - Can be extended to support arbitrary new types.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OTHER CTAGS-COMPATIBLE PROGRAMS				*tagbar-other*

Tagbar theoretically also supports filetype-specific programs that can output
tag information that is compatible with ctags. However due to potential
incompatibilities this may not always completely work. Tagbar has been tested
with doctorjs/jsctags and will use that if present, other programs require
some configuration (see |tagbar-extend|). If a program does not work even with
correct configuration please contact me.

Note: Please check |tagbar-issues| for some possible issues with jsctags.

==============================================================================
2. Requirements						*tagbar-requirements*

The following requirements have to be met in order to be able to use tagbar:

  - Vim 7.0 or higher. Older versions will not work since Tagbar uses data
    structures that were only introduced in Vim 7.
  - Exuberant ctags 5.5 or higher. Ctags is the program that generates the
    tag information that Tagbar uses. It is shipped with most Linux
    distributions, otherwise it can be downloaded from the following
    website:

        http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

    Tagbar will work on any platform that ctags runs on -- this includes
    UNIX derivatives, Mac OS X and Windows. Note that other versions like
    GNU ctags will not work.
    Tagbar generates the tag information by itself and doesn't need (or use)
    already existing tag files.
  - File type detection must be turned on in vim. This can be done with the
    following command in your vimrc:
>
        filetype on
<
    See |filetype| for more information.
  - Tagbar will not work in |restricted-mode| or with 'compatible' set.

==============================================================================
3. Installation						*tagbar-installation*

Use the normal Vimball install method for installing tagbar.vba:
>
	vim tagbar.vba
	:so %
	:q
<
Alternatively you can clone the git repository and then add the path to
'runtimepath' or use the pathogen plugin. Don't forget to run |:helptags| if
you're not using pathogen.

If the ctags executable is not installed in one of the directories in your
$PATH environment variable you have to set the g:tagbar_ctags_bin variable,
see |g:tagbar_ctags_bin|.

==============================================================================
4. Usage						*tagbar-usage*

There are essentially two ways to use Tagbar:

  1. Have it running all the time in a window on the side of the screen. In
     this case Tagbar will update its contents whenever the source file is
     changed and highlight the tag the cursor is currently on in the file. If
     a tag is selected in Tagbar the file window will jump to the tag and the
     Tagbar window will stay open. |g:tagbar_autoclose| has to be unset for
     this mode.
  2. Only open Tagbar when you want to jump to a specific tag and have it
     close automatically once you have selected one. This can be useful for
     example for small screens where a permanent window would take up too much
     space. You have to set the option |g:tagbar_autoclose| in this case. The
     cursor will also automatically jump to the Tagbar window when opening it.

Opening and closing the Tagbar window~
Use |:TagbarOpen| or |:TagbarToggle| to open the Tagbar window if it is
closed. By default the window is opened on the right side, set the option
|g:tagbar_left| to open it on the left instead. If the window is already open,
|:TagbarOpen| will jump to it and |:TagbarToggle| will close it again.
|:TagbarClose| will simply close the window if it is open.

It is probably a good idea to assign a key to these commands. For example, put
this in your |vimrc|:
>
	nnoremap <silent> <F9> :TagbarToggle<CR>
<
You can then open and close Tagbar by simply pressing the <F9> key.

You can also use |:TagbarOpenAutoClose| to open the Tagbar window, jump to it
and have it close automatically on tag selection regardless of the
|g:tagbar_autoclose| setting.

Jumping to tags~
When you're inside the Tagbar window you can jump to the definition of a tag
by moving the cursor to a tag and pressing <Enter> or double-clicking on it
with the mouse. The source file will then move to the definition and put the
cursor in the corresponding line. This won't work for pseudo-tags.

Sorting~
You can sort the tags in the Tagbar window in two ways: by name or by file
order. Sorting them by name simply displays the tags in their alphabetical
order under their corresponding scope. Sorting by file order means that the
tags keep the order they have in the source file, but are still associated
with the correct scope. You can change the sort order by pressing the "s" key
in the Tagbar window. The current sort order is displayed in the statusbar of
the Tagbar window.

Folding~
The displayed scopes (and unscoped types) can be folded to hide uninteresting
information. Mappings similar to Vim's built-in ones are provided. Folds can
also be opened and closed by clicking on the fold icon with the mouse.

Displaying the prototype of a tag~
Tagbar can display the prototype of a tag. More precisely it can display the
line in which the tag is defined. This can be done by either pressing <Space>
when on a tag or hovering over a tag with the mouse. In the former case the
prototype will be displayed in the command line |Command-line|, in the latter
case it will be displayed in a pop-up window. The prototype will also be
displayed when the cursor stays on a tag for 'updatetime' milliseconds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS						*tagbar-commands*

:TagbarOpen [{flags}]
    Open the Tagbar window if it is closed.

    Additional behaviour can be specified with the optional {flags} argument.
    It is a string which can contain these character flags:
    'f'   Jump to Tagbar window when opening (just as if |g:tagbar_autofocus|
          were set to 1)
    'j'   Jump to Tagbar window if already open
    'c'   Close Tagbar on tag selection (just as if |g:tagbar_autoclose| were
          set to 1, but doesn't imply 'f')

    For example, the following command would always jump to the Tagbar window,
    opening it first if necessary, but keep it open after selecting a tag
    (unless |g:tagbar_autoclose| is set): >
        :TagbarOpen fj
<
:TagbarClose
    Close the Tagbar window if it is open.

:TagbarToggle
    Open the Tagbar window if it is closed or close it if it is open.

:TagbarOpenAutoClose
    Open the Tagbar window, jump to it and close it on tag selection. This is
    an alias for ":TagbarOpen fc".

:TagbarSetFoldlevel {number}
    Set the foldlevel of the tags of the current file to {number}. The
    foldlevel of tags in other files remains unaffected. Works in the same way
    as 'foldlevel'.

:TagbarShowTag
    Open the parent folds of the current tag in the file window as much as
    needed for the tag to be visible in the Tagbar window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS						*tagbar-keys*

The following mappings are valid in the Tagbar window:

<F1>          Display key mapping help.
<CR>/<Enter>  Jump to the tag under the cursor. Doesn't work for pseudo-tags
              or generic headers.
p             Jump to the tag under the cursor, but stay in the Tagbar window.
<LeftMouse>   When on a fold icon, open or close the fold depending on the
              current state.
<2-LeftMouse> Same as <CR>. See |g:tagbar_singleclick| if you want to use a
              single- instead of a double-click.
<Space>       Display the prototype of the current tag (i.e. the line defining
              it) in the command line.
+/zo          Open the fold under the cursor.
-/zc          Close the fold under the cursor or the current one if there is
              no fold under the cursor.
o/za          Toggle the fold under the cursor or the current one if there is
              no fold under the cursor.
*/zR          Open all folds by setting foldlevel to 99.
=/zM          Close all folds by setting foldlevel to 0.
<C-N>         Go to the next top-level tag.
<C-P>         Go to the previous top-level tag.
s             Toggle sort order between name and file order.
x             Toggle zooming the window.
q             Close the Tagbar window.

==============================================================================
5. Configuration					*tagbar-configuration*

							*g:tagbar_ctags_bin*
g:tagbar_ctags_bin~
Default: empty

Use this option to specify the location of your ctags executable. Only needed
if it is not in one of the directories in your $PATH environment variable.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_ctags_bin = 'C:\Ctags5.8\ctags.exe'
<

							*g:tagbar_left*
g:tagbar_left~
Default: 0

By default the Tagbar window will be opened on the right-hand side of vim. Set
this option to open it on the left instead.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_left = 1
<

							*g:tagbar_width*
g:tagbar_width~
Default: 40

Width of the Tagbar window in characters.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_width = 30
<

							*g:tagbar_autoclose*
g:tagbar_autoclose~
Default: 0

If you set this option the Tagbar window will automatically close when you
jump to a tag. This implies |g:tagbar_autofocus|.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_autoclose = 1
<

							*g:tagbar_autofocus*
g:tagbar_autofocus~
Default: 0

If you set this option the cursor will move to the Tagbar window when it is
opened.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_autofocus = 1
<

							*g:tagbar_sort*
g:tagbar_sort~
Default: 1

If this option is set the tags are sorted according to their name. If it is
unset they are sorted according to their order in the source file. Note that
in the second case Pseudo-tags are always sorted before normal tags of the
same kind since they don't have a real position in the file.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_sort = 0
<

							*g:tagbar_compact*
g:tagbar_compact~
Default: 0

Setting this option will result in Tagbar omitting the short help at the
top of the window and the blank lines in between top-level scopes in order to
save screen real estate.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_compact = 1
<

							*g:tagbar_expand*
g:tagbar_expand~
Default: 0

If this option is set the Vim window will be expanded by the width of the
Tagbar window if using a GUI version of Vim.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_expand = 1
<

							*g:tagbar_singleclick*
g:tagbar_singleclick~
Default: 0

If this option is set then a single- instead of a double-click is used to jump
to the tag definition.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_singleclick = 1
<

							*g:tagbar_foldlevel*
g:tagbar_foldlevel~
Default: 99

The initial foldlevel for folds in the Tagbar window. Fold with a level higher
than this number will be closed.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_foldlevel = 2
<

							*g:tagbar_usearrows*
g:tagbar_usearrows~
{Windows only}
Default: 0

Tagbar can display nice Unicode arrows instead of +/- characters as fold icons.
However, Windows doesn't seem to be able to substitute in characters from
other fonts if the current font doesn't support them. This means that you have
to use a font that supports those arrows. Unfortunately there is no way to
detect whether specific characters are supported in the current font. So if
your font supports those arrows you have to set this option to make it work.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_usearrows = 1
<

							*g:tagbar_autoshowtag*
g:tagbar_autoshowtag~
Default: 0

If this variable is set and the current tag is inside of a closed fold then
the folds will be opened as much as needed for the tag to be visible so it can
be highlighted. If it is not set then the folds won't be opened and the parent
tag will be highlighted instead. You can use the TagbarShowTag command to open
the folds manually.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_autoshowtag = 1
<

						*g:tagbar_updateonsave_maxlines*
g:tagbar_updateonsave_maxlines~
Default: 5000

If the current file has fewer lines than the value of this variable, Tagbar
will update immediately after saving the file. If it is longer then the update
will only happen on the |CursorHold| event and when switching buffers (or
windows). This is to prevent the time it takes to save a large file from
becoming annoying in case you have a slow computer. If you have a fast
computer you can set it to a higher value.

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_updateonsave_maxlines = 10000
<

							*g:tagbar_systemenc*
g:tagbar_systemenc~
Default: value of 'encoding'

This variable is for cases where the character encoding of your operating
system is different from the one set in Vim, i.e. the 'encoding' option. For
example, if you use a Simplified Chinese Windows version that has a system
encoding of "cp936", and you have set 'encoding' to "utf-8", then you would
have to set this variable to "cp936".

Example:
>
	let g:tagbar_systemenc = 'cp936'
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGHLIGHT COLOURS					*tagbar-highlight*

All of the colours used by Tagbar can be customized. Here is a list of the
highlight groups that are defined by Tagbar:

TagbarComment
    The help at the top of the buffer.

TagbarKind
    The header of generic "kinds" like "functions" and "variables".

TagbarNestedKind
    The "kind" headers in square brackets inside of scopes.

TagbarScope
    Tags that define a scope like classes, structs etc.

TagbarType
    The type of a tag or scope if available.

TagbarSignature
    Function signatures.

TagbarPseudoID
    The asterisk (*) that signifies a pseudo-tag.

TagbarFoldIcon
    The fold icon on the left of foldable tags.

TagbarHighlight
    The colour that is used for automatically highlighting the current tag.

TagbarAccessPublic
    The "public" visibility/access symbol.

TagbarAccessProtected
    The "protected" visibility/access symbol.

TagbarAccessPrivate
    The "private" visibility/access symbol.

If you want to change any of those colours put a line like the following in
your vimrc:
>
	highlight TagbarScope guifg=Green ctermfg=Green
<
See |:highlight| for more information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOMATICALLY OPENING TAGBAR				*tagbar-autoopen*

If you want Tagbar to open automatically, for example on Vim startup or for
specific filetypes, there are various ways to do it. For example, to always
open Tagbar on Vim startup you can put this into your vimrc file:
>
    autocmd VimEnter * nested TagbarOpen
<
If you want to have it start for specific filetypes put
>
    TagbarOpen
<
into a corresponding filetype plugin (see |filetype-plugin|).

Check out |autocmd.txt| if you want it to automatically open in more
complicated cases.

==============================================================================
6. Extending Tagbar					*tagbar-extend*

Tagbar has a flexible mechanism for extending the existing file type (i.e.
language) definitions. This can be used both to change the settings of the
existing types and to add completely new types. A complete configuration
consists of a type definition for Tagbar in your |vimrc| and optionally a
language definition for ctags in case you want to add a new language.

Before writing your own extension try googling for already existing ones. For
example, here is one for Scala:
http://latestbuild.net/scala-ctags-and-vim-tagbar
Since those aren't "canonical" configurations and are somewhat subjective they
probably won't be included in Tagbar, but it is easy enough to just copy&paste
them into your own setup. Note that you don't have to modify Tagbar directly
like the article suggests, you can just put the configuration into your
|vimrc| (see below for more details).


Every type definition in Tagbar is a dictionary with the following keys:

ctagstype:  The name of the language as recognized by ctags. Use the command >
                ctags --list-languages
<           to get a list of the languages ctags supports. The case doesn't
            matter.
kinds:      A list of the "language kinds" that should be listed in Tagbar,
            ordered by the order they should appear in in the Tagbar window.
            Use the command >
                ctags --list-kinds={language name}
<           to get a list of the kinds ctags supports for a given language. An
            entry in this list is a string with two or three parts separated
            by a colon: the first part is the one-character abbreviation that
            ctags uses, and the second part is an arbitrary string that will
            be used in Tagbar as the header for the tags of this kind that are
            not listed under a specific scope. The optional third part
            determines whether tags of this kind should be folded by default,
            with 1 meaning they should be folded and 0 they should not. If
            this part is omitted the tags will not be folded by default. For
            example, the string >
                "f:functions:1"
<           would list all the function definitions in a file under the header
            "functions" and fold them.
sro:        The scope resolution operator. For example, in C++ it is "::" and
            in Java it is ".". If in doubt run ctags as shown below and check
            the output.
kind2scope: A dictionary describing the mapping of tag kinds (in their
            one-character representation) to the scopes their children will
            appear in, for example classes, structs etc.
            Unfortunately there is no ctags option to list the scopes, you
            have to look at the tags ctags generates manually. For example,
            let's say we have a C++ file "test.cpp" with the following
            contents: >
                class Foo
                {
                public:
                    Foo();
                    ~Foo();
                private:
                    int var;
                };
<           We then run ctags in the following way: >
                ctags -f - --format=2 --excmd=pattern --extra= --fields=nksaSmt test.cpp
<           Then the output for the variable "var" would look like this: >
                var	tmp.cpp /^    int var;$/;"	kind:m	line:11	class:Foo	access:private
<           This shows that the scope name for an entry in a C++ class is
            simply "class". So this would be the word that the "kind"
            character of a class has to be mapped to.
scope2kind: The opposite of the above, mapping scopes to the kinds of their
            parents. Most of the time it is the exact inverse of the above,
            but in some cases it can be different, for example when more than
            one kind maps to the same scope. If it is the exact inverse for
            your language you only need to specify one of the two keys.
replace:    If you set this entry to 1 your definition will completely replace
{optional}  an existing default definition. This is useful if you want to
            disable scopes for a file type for some reason. Note that in this
            case you have to provide all the needed entries yourself!
sort:       This entry can be used to override the global sort setting for
{optional}  this specific file type. The meaning of the value is the same as
            with the global setting, that is if you want to sort tags by name
            set it to 1 and if you want to sort them according to their order
            in the file set it to 0.
deffile:    The path to a file with additional ctags definitions (see the
{optional}  section below on adding a new definition for what exactly that
            means). This is especially useful for ftplugins since they can
            provide a complete type definition with ctags and Tagbar
            configurations without requiring user intervention.
            Let's say you have an ftplugin that adds support for the language
            "mylang", and your directory structure looks like this: >
                ctags/mylang.cnf
                ftplugin/mylang.vim
<           Then the "deffile" entry would look like this to allow for the
            plugin to be installed in an arbitray location (for example
            with pathogen): >

                'deffile' : expand('<sfile>:p:h:h') . '/ctags/mylang.cnf'
<
ctagsbin:  The path to a filetype-specific ctags-compatible program like
{optional} jsctags. Set it in the same way as |g:tagbar_ctags_bin|. jsctags is
           used automatically if found in your $PATH and does not have to be
           set in that case. If it is not in your path you have to provide the
           complete configuration and use the "replace" key (see the
           Tagbar source code for the suggested configuration).
ctagsargs: The arguments to be passed to the filetype-specific ctags program
{optional} (without the filename). Make sure you set an option that makes the
           program output its data on stdout. Not used for the normal ctags
           program.


You then have to assign this dictionary to a variable in your vimrc with the
name
>
	g:tagbar_type_{vim filetype}
<
For example, for C++ the name would be "g:tagbar_type_cpp". If you don't know
the vim file type then run the following command:
>
	:set filetype?
<
and vim will display the file type of the current buffer.

Example: C++~
Here is a complete example that shows the default configuration for C++ as
used in Tagbar. This is just for illustration purposes since user
configurations will usually be less complicated.
>
	let g:tagbar_type_cpp = {
	    \ 'ctagstype' : 'c++',
	    \ 'kinds'     : [
	        \ 'd:macros:1',
	        \ 'p:prototypes:1',
	        \ 'g:enums',
	        \ 'e:enumerators',
	        \ 't:typedefs',
	        \ 'n:namespaces',
	        \ 'c:classes',
	        \ 's:structs',
	        \ 'u:unions',
	        \ 'f:functions',
	        \ 'm:members',
	        \ 'v:variables'
	    \ ],
	    \ 'sro'        : '::',
	    \ 'kind2scope' : {
	        \ 'g' : 'enum',
	        \ 'n' : 'namespace',
	        \ 'c' : 'class',
	        \ 's' : 'struct',
	        \ 'u' : 'union'
	    \ },
	    \ 'scope2kind' : {
	        \ 'enum'      : 'g',
	        \ 'namespace' : 'n',
	        \ 'class'     : 'c',
	        \ 'struct'    : 's',
	        \ 'union'     : 'u'
	    \ }
	\ }
<

Which of the keys you have to specify depends on what you want to do.

Changing an existing definition~
If you want to change an existing definition you only need to specify the
parts that you want to change. It probably only makes sense to change "kinds"
and/or "scopes", which would be the case if you wanted to exclude certain
kinds from appearing in Tagbar or if you want to change their order. As an
example, if you didn't want Tagbar to show prototypes for C++ files and switch
the order of enums and typedefs, you would do it like this:
>
	let g:tagbar_type_cpp = {
	    \ 'kinds' : [
	        \ 'd:macros:1',
	        \ 'g:enums',
	        \ 't:typedefs',
	        \ 'e:enumerators',
	        \ 'n:namespaces',
	        \ 'c:classes',
	        \ 's:structs',
	        \ 'u:unions',
	        \ 'f:functions',
	        \ 'm:members',
	        \ 'v:variables'
	    \ ]
	\ }
<
Compare with the complete example above to see the difference.

Adding a definition for a new language/file type~
In order to be able to add a new language to Tagbar you first have to create a
configuration for ctags that it can use to parse the files. This can be done
in two ways:

  1. Use the --regex argument for specifying regular expressions that are used
     to parse the files. An example of this is given below. A disadvantage of
     this approach is that you can't specify scopes.
  2. Write a parser plugin in C for ctags. This approach is much more powerful
     than the regex approach since you can make use of all of ctags'
     functionality but it also requires much more work. Read the ctags
     documentation for more information about how to do this.

For the first approach the only keys that are needed in the Tagbar definition
are "ctagstype" and "kinds". A definition that supports scopes has to define
those two and in addition "scopes", "sro" and at least one of "kind2scope" and
"scope2kind".

Let's assume we want to add support for LaTeX to Tagbar using the regex
approach. First we put the following text into ~/.ctags or a file pointed to
by the "deffile" definition entry:
>
	--langdef=latex
	--langmap=latex:.tex
	--regex-latex=/^\\tableofcontents/TABLE OF CONTENTS/s,toc/
	--regex-latex=/^\\frontmatter/FRONTMATTER/s,frontmatter/
	--regex-latex=/^\\mainmatter/MAINMATTER/s,mainmatter/
	--regex-latex=/^\\backmatter/BACKMATTER/s,backmatter/
	--regex-latex=/^\\bibliography\{/BIBLIOGRAPHY/s,bibliography/
	--regex-latex=/^\\part[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/PART \2/s,part/
	--regex-latex=/^\\part[[:space:]]*\*[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/PART \1/s,part/
	--regex-latex=/^\\chapter[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/CHAP \2/s,chapter/
	--regex-latex=/^\\chapter[[:space:]]*\*[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/CHAP \1/s,chapter/
	--regex-latex=/^\\section[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\. \2/s,section/
	--regex-latex=/^\\section[[:space:]]*\*[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\. \1/s,section/
	--regex-latex=/^\\subsection[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\.\. \2/s,subsection/
	--regex-latex=/^\\subsection[[:space:]]*\*[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\.\. \1/s,subsection/
	--regex-latex=/^\\subsubsection[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\.\.\. \2/s,subsubsection/
	--regex-latex=/^\\subsubsection[[:space:]]*\*[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\.\.\. \1/s,subsubsection/
	--regex-latex=/^\\includegraphics[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\3/g,graphic+listing/
	--regex-latex=/^\\lstinputlisting[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*(\[[^]]*\])?[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\3/g,graphic+listing/
	--regex-latex=/\\label[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\1/l,label/
	--regex-latex=/\\ref[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\1/r,ref/
	--regex-latex=/\\pageref[[:space:]]*\{([^}]+)\}/\1/p,pageref/
<
This will create a new language definition with the name "latex" and associate
it with files with the extension ".tex". It will also define the kinds "s" for
sections, chapters and the like, "g" for included graphics, "l" for labels,
"r" for references and "p" for page references. See the ctags documentation
for more information about the exact syntax.

Now we have to create the Tagbar language definition in our vimrc:
>
	let g:tagbar_type_tex = {
	    \ 'ctagstype' : 'latex',
	    \ 'kinds'     : [
	        \ 's:sections',
	        \ 'g:graphics',
	        \ 'l:labels',
	        \ 'r:refs:1',
	        \ 'p:pagerefs:1'
	    \ ],
	    \ 'sort'    : 0,
	    \ 'deffile' : expand('<sfile>:p:h:h') . '/ctags/latex.cnf'
	\ }
<
The "deffile" field is of course only needed if the ctags definition actually
is in that file and not in ~/.ctags.

Sort has been disabled for LaTeX so that the sections appear in their correct
order. They unfortunately can't be shown nested with their correct scopes
since as already mentioned the regular expression approach doesn't support
that.

Tagbar should now be able to show the sections and other tags from LaTeX
files.

==============================================================================
7. Troubleshooting & Known issues			*tagbar-issues*

As a general rule, if the tag information displayed by Tagbar is wrong (for
example, a method doesn't show up or is in the wrong place) you should first
try running ctags manually to see whether ctags reports the wrong information
or whether that information is correct and Tagbar does something wrong. To run
ctags manually execute the following command in a terminal:
>
	ctags -f - --format=2 --excmd=pattern --extra= --fields=nksaSmt myfile
<
If you set the |g:tagbar_ctags_bin| variable you probably have to use the same
value here instead of simply "ctags".


  - jsctags has to be newer than 2011-01-06 since it needs the "-f" option to
    work. Also, the output of jsctags seems to be a bit unreliable at the
    moment (especially regarding line numbers), so if you notice some strange
    behaviour with it please run it manually in a terminal to check whether
    the bug is in jsctags or Tagbar.

  - Nested pseudo-tags cannot be properly parsed since only the direct parent
    scope of a tag gets assigned a type, the type of the grandparents is not
    reported by ctags (assuming the grandparents don't have direct, real
    children).

    For example, if we have a C++ file with the following content:
>
        foo::Bar::init()
        {
            // ...
        }
        foo::Baz::method()
        {
            // ...
        }
<
    In this case the type of "foo" is not known. Is it a namespace? A class?
    For this reason the methods are displayed in Tagbar like this:
>
        foo::Bar* : class
          init()
        foo::Baz* : class
          method()
<
  - Scope-defining tags at the top level that have the same name but a
    different kind/scope type can lead to an incorrect display. For example,
    the following Python code will incorrectly insert a pseudo-tag "Inner2"
    into the "test" class:
>
        class test:
            class Inner:
                def foo(self):
                    pass

        def test():
            class Inner2:
                def bar(self):
                    pass
<
    I haven't found a clean way around this yet, but it shouldn't be much of a
    problem in practice anyway. Tags with the same name at any other level are
    no problem, though.

==============================================================================
8. History						*tagbar-history*

2.2 (2011-11-26)
    - Small incompatible change: TagbarOpen now doesn't jump to the Tagbar
      window anymore if it is already open. Use "TagbarOpen j" instead or see
      its documentation for more options.
    - Tags inside of scopes now have a header displaying their "kind".
    - The Tagbar contents are now immediately updated on save for files
      smaller than a configurable size.
    - Tagbar can now be configured to jump to a tag with only a single-click
      instead of a double-click.
    - Most of the script has been moved to the |autoload| directory, so Vim
      startup should be faster (thanks to Kien N).
    - Jumping to tags should work most of the time even if the file has been
      modified and not saved.
    - If Ctags has been installed into the default location using Homebrew or
      MacPorts it should now be found automatically.
    - Several bugfixes.

2.1 (2011-05-29)
    - Make Tagbar work in (hopefully) all cases under Windows
    - Handle cases where 'encoding' is different from system encoding, for
      example on a Chinese Windows with 'encoding' set to "utf-8" (see manual
      for details in case it doesn't work out-of-the-box)
    - Fixed a bug with the handling of subtypes like "python.django"
    - If a session got saved with Tagbar open it now gets restored properly
    - Locally reset foldmethod/foldexpr in case foldexpr got set to something
      expensive globally
    - Tagbar now tries hard to go to the correct window when jumping to a tag
    - Explain some possible issues with the current jsctags version in the
      manual
    - Explicitly check for some possible configuration problems to be able to
      give better feedback
    - A few other small fixes

2.0.1 (2011-04-26)
    - Fix sorting bug when 'ignorecase' is set

2.0 (2011-04-26)
    - Folding now works correctly. Folds will be preserved when leaving the
      Tagbar window and when switching between files. Also tag types can be
      configured to be folded by default, which is useful for things like
      includes and imports.
    - DoctorJS/jsctags and other compatible programs are now supported.
    - All of the highlight groups can now be overridden.
    - Added keybinding to quickly jump to next/previous top-level tag.
    - Added Taglist's "p" keybinding for jumping to a tag without leaving the
      Tagbar window.
    - Several bugfixes and other small improvements.

1.5 (2011-03-06)
    - Type definitions can now include a path to a file with the ctags
      definition. This is especially useful for ftplugins that can now ship
      with a complete ctags and Tagbar configuration without requiring user
      intervention. Thanks to Jan Christoph Ebersbach for the suggestion.
    - Added autofocus setting by Taybin Rutkin. This will put the cursor in
      the Tagbar window when it is opened.
    - The "scopes" field is no longer needed in type definitions, the
      information is already there in "scope2kind". Existing definitions will
      be ignored.
    - Some fixes and improvements related to redrawing and window switching.

1.2 (2011-02-28)
    - Fix typo in Ruby definition

1.1 (2011-02-26)
    - Don't lose syntax highlighting when ':syntax enable' is called
    - Allow expanding the Vim window when Tagbar is opened

1.0 (2011-02-23)
    - Initial release

==============================================================================
9. Todo							*tagbar-todo*

  - Allow filtering the Tagbar content by some criteria like tag name,
    visibility, kind ...
  - Integrate Tagbar with the FSwitch plugin to provide header file
    information in C/C++.
  - Allow jumping to a tag in the preview window, a split window or a new tab.

==============================================================================
